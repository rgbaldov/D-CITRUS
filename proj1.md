## Abstract
This project develops a digital twin framework with smart sensing technologies to _**optimize citrus post-processing**_, particularly sorting and packaging. A virtual model of the system will be synchronized with real-time data from IoT-enabled sensors that monitor fruit quality, machine performance, and environmental conditions. The digital twin will simulate operations, predict equipment issues, and enhance sorting accuracy based on fruit size, color, and defects. By enabling data-driven decision-making, the project improves product quality, reduces postharvest losses, and increases efficiency. This foundation supports scalable and intelligent postharvest handling solutions for the citrus industry and beyond.

## Objectives
To develop and implement a digital twin-enabled manufacturing framework that enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability of citrus post-processing through intelligent sorting and packaging automation.

**Specific Objectives:**
- To **develop** the digital twin of the citrus sorting and packaging line  
- To **integrate** real-time data from sensors (size, weight, color, defects), and  
- To **build** a synchronized virtual-physical system for monitoring and control
