The project introduces **D-CITRUS**, a smart manufacturing framework designed to enhance citrus post-processing. By integrating **_digital twin_** technology, the system creates a virtual replica of the sorting and packaging process, enabling _real-time monitoring_, _simulation_, and _optimization_. Structured into three sub-projects, **D-CITRUS** aims to improve accuracy in fruit classification, reduce waste, and streamline packaging operations while ensuring product quality. The system promotes efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness in citrus manufacturing. Ultimately, **D-CITRUS** provides a scalable solution for modernizing agricultural post-processing, aligning with the shift toward Industry 4.0 and intelligent food production systems.

## Proposed Budget: _~PhP 20 M_
